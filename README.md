# Problem Statement
Suppose I own an ice-cream business and would like to create a model that predict the daily revenue in dollars based on outside temperature(degree celsius).
(Problem taken from Coursera).
# DataSet 
X : The Temperature in Degree Celsius.
Y : Revenue in Dollars.
# Explaination : Simple Linear Regression
In this we predict the value of one variable Y based on another variable X.
X is called as independent variable and Y is called as dependent variable.
It is simple because it examines the relationship between two variables only.
It is linear because when independent variable increases( or decreases), dependent variable increases(or decreases) in linear fashion.
# Equation used in this Problem:
Y = b + mX
Y = Dependent variable
b = y intercept 
m = Slope
X = Independent variable
